## Acknowledgements

We acknowledge [Bond order
analysis](https://github.com/WolfgangLechner/StructureAnalysis) code for the
inspiration and the base for what later grew to be `pyscal`. We are also
thankful to the developers of [Voro++](math.lbl.gov/voro++/) and
[pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for developing
the great tools that we could use in `pyscal`.

We are grateful to Alberto Ferrari, Abril Azócar Guzmán, Matteo Rinaldi
and Yanyan Liang for helping with testing the code and providing
valuable feedback. We also thank Mahesh Prasad for the helpful
discussions in the implementation of this module.
