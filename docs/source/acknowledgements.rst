Acknowledgements
----------------

We acknowledge `Bond order analysis <https://homepage.univie.ac.at/wolfgang.lechner/>`_ code for the inspiration and the base for what later grew to be ``pyscal``. We are also thankful to the developers of `Voro++ <math.lbl.gov/voro++/>`_ and `pybind11 <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for developing the great tools that we could use in ``pyscal``.

We are grateful to Alberto Ferrari, Abril Azócar Guzmán, Matteo Rinaldi and Yanyan Liang for helping with testing the code and providing valuable feedback.  We also thank Mahesh Prasad for the helpful discussions in the implementation of this module.
